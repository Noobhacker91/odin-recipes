# odin-recipes
This Repo is about My basic html skills i have learned through The Odin Project.
Till now I have learned html elements e.g. doctype,html,head,body,h1-h6,p,img,
a, and attributes like href for a and src for img, with that i know how  to file structure 
so that the project can be organised.

i am also starting the project named Odin-recipes to make a skeleton of a website 
using html.
